Hi there, I am Yuankun Xie, currently a second-year Ph.D. student at the Communication University of China and engaged in joint Ph.D. training at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

My research interests include audio deepfake detection, speech synthesis, and voice conversion. I have published over 10 papers in top international audio conferences and journals.
